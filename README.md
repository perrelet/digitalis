### Digitally Down to Earth

“Foxglove, Foxglove,  
What do you see?”  
The cool green woodland,  
The fat velvet bee;  
Hey, Mr Bumble,  
I’ve honey here for thee!  

“Foxglove, Foxglove,  
What see you now?”  
The soft summer moonlight  
On bracken, grass, and bough;  
And all the fairies dancing  
As only they know how.
